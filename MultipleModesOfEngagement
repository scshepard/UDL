Engagement is the why of learning
As you have learned, educators should anticipate differences in how their students learn and identify potential barriers within the instructional components. Even when they do so, educators may encounter challenges when designing instructional experiences for variable learners. The UDL framework is built on three principles that guide educators to plan more than one way (i.e., multiple means) to engage students, to represent content, and to promote student expression. By applying these three principles, educators design flexible instructional experiences that incorporate options for learners. Let’s explore these principles in greater depth.
The first principle is about the “why” of learning—students’ motivation and attitude toward learning. When designing with this principle in mind, educators proactively plan more than one way to incorporate students’ interests, to encourage their efforts, and to promote self-regulation while learning. Examples of providing multiple means of engagement include:
•	Inviting students to choose their own topic for an assignment or project
•	Incorporating authentic activities that reflect real-world situations
•	Generating multiple examples to connect new content to students’ backgrounds and experiences
•	Creating opportunities for peer interaction and collaboration
•	Providing feedback that emphasizes effort and progress (How can educators design instruction that engages and challenges all students?, 2024)

Universal Design for Learning (UDL) also emphasizes the importance of multiple means of engagement to tap into learners' interests, offer appropriate challenges, and increase motivation. Here are examples of UDL's multiple means of engagement, supported by scholarly citations.
1. Offering Choices
Providing students with choices in their learning process increases engagement by allowing them to pursue topics of interest and demonstrate their learning in ways that best suit their strengths.
•	Example: Allowing students to choose from various project topics or letting them decide how to present their research, such as through a video, a written report, or a presentation.
•	Citation: Katz, J., & Sugden, R. (2013). The Three-Block Model of Universal Design for Learning Implementation in a High School. Canadian Journal of Educational Administration and Policy, (141), 1-28.
2. Incorporating Student Interests
Connecting learning activities to students' personal interests and real-world experiences makes the content more relevant and engaging.
•	Example: Using current events or popular culture references in assignments and discussions to make the material more relatable and engaging.
•	Citation: Meyer, A., Rose, D. H., & Gordon, D. (2014). Universal Design for Learning: Theory and Practice. CAST Professional Publishing.
3. Providing Opportunities for Collaboration
Encouraging collaborative learning through group projects and peer interactions fosters a sense of community and engagement.
•	Example: Group assignments where students must work together to solve a problem or create a project, enhancing their social and collaborative skills.
•	Citation: Hall, T. E., Meyer, A., & Rose, D. H. (2012). Universal Design for Learning in the Classroom: Practical Applications. Guilford Press.
4. Setting Personalized Goals and Self-Reflection
Allowing students to set their own learning goals and reflect on their progress increases ownership and motivation.
•	Example: Implementing self-assessment tools and reflection journals where students can track their progress and set new learning targets.
•	Citation: Rose, D. H., & Meyer, A. (2002). Teaching Every Student in the Digital Age: Universal Design for Learning. ASCD.
5. Using Gamification
Integrating game-like elements into the learning environment can make learning more engaging and fun.
•	Example: Creating a points system for completing tasks, incorporating game-based learning apps, or using competition to motivate students.
•	Citation: Gee, J. P. (2008). Learning and Games. In K. Salen (Ed.), The Ecology of Games: Connecting Youth, Games, and Learning (pp. 21-40). MIT Press.
6. Flexible Groupings and Learning Environments
Creating a variety of learning environments and flexible groupings can cater to different preferences and increase engagement.
•	Example: Offering quiet spaces for individual work, collaborative spaces for group work, and comfortable seating options to accommodate various learning styles.
•	Citation: CAST (2011). Universal Design for Learning Guidelines version 2.0. Wakefield, MA: Author. Available at: http://www.udlcenter.org/aboutudl/udlguidelines
7. Encouraging Autonomy and Independence
Promoting student autonomy by giving them control over their learning process can enhance engagement and motivation.
•	Example: Using project-based learning where students have to plan, research, and execute projects with minimal direct instruction.
•	Citation: Deci, E. L., & Ryan, R. M. (2000). The "What" and "Why" of Goal Pursuits: Human Needs and the Self-Determination of Behavior. Psychological Inquiry, 11(4), 227-268.
8. Incorporating Diverse Learning Activities
Using a variety of instructional methods and activities can address different learning preferences and keep students engaged.
•	Example: Combining lectures, hands-on activities, discussions, and multimedia resources in the curriculum to maintain student interest.
•	Citation: Meyer, A., Rose, D. H., & Gordon, D. (2014). Universal Design for Learning: Theory and Practice. CAST Professional Publishing.
By implementing these strategies, educators can create a more engaging and motivating learning environment that meets the diverse needs of all students.

Engagement
Affect represents a crucial element to learning, and learners differ markedly in the ways in which they can be engaged or motivated to learn. There are a variety of sources that can influence individual variation in affect including neurology, culture, personal relevance, subjectivity, and background knowledge, along with a variety of other factors. Some learners are highly engaged by spontaneity and novelty while others are disengaged, even frightened, by those aspects, preferring strict routine. Some learners might like to work alone, while others prefer to work with their peers. In reality, there is not one means of engagement that will be optimal for all learners in all contexts; providing multiple options for engagement is essential.
GUIDELINE 7
Provide options for Recruiting Interest
Information that is not attended to, that does not engage learners’ cognition, is in fact inaccessible. It is inaccessible both in the moment and in the future, because relevant information goes unnoticed and unprocessed. As a result, teachers devote considerable effort to recruiting learner attention and engagement. But learners differ significantly in what attracts their attention and engages their interest. Even the same learner will differ over time and circumstance; their “interests” change as they develop and gain new knowledge and skills, as their biological environments change, and as they develop into self-determined adolescents and adults. It is, therefore, important to have alternative ways to recruit learner interest, ways that reflect the important inter- and intra-individual differences amongst learners.
Recruiting Interest
CHECKPOINT 7.1
Optimize individual choice and autonomy
•	Provide learners with as much discretion and autonomy as possible by providing choices in such things as:
o	The level of perceived challenge
o	The type of rewards or recognition available
o	The context or content used for practicing and assessing skills
o	The tools used for information gathering or production
o	The color, design, or graphics of layouts, etc.
o	The sequence or timing for completion of subcomponents of tasks
•	Allow learners to participate in the design of classroom activities and academic tasks
•	Involve learners, where and whenever possible, in setting their own personal academic and behavioral goals
•	CHECKPOINT 7.2
•	Optimize relevance, value, and authenticity
Individuals are engaged by information and activities that are relevant and valuable to their interests and goals. This does not necessarily mean that the situation has to be equivalent to real life, as fiction can be just as engaging to learners as non-fiction, but it does have to be relevant and authentic to learners’ individual goals and the instructional goals. Individuals are rarely interested in information and activities that have no relevance or value. In an educational setting, one of the most important ways that teachers recruit interest is to highlight the utility and relevance, of learning and to demonstrate that relevance through authentic, meaningful activities. It is a mistake, of course, to assume that all learners will find the same activities or information equally relevant or valuable to their goals. To recruit all learners equally, it is critical to provide options that optimize what is relevant, valuable, and meaningful to the learner.
•	Vary activities and sources of information so that they can be:
o	Personalized and contextualized to learners’ lives
o	Culturally relevant and responsive
o	Socially relevant
o	Age and ability appropriate
o	Appropriate for different racial, cultural, ethnic, and gender groups
•	Design activities so that learning outcomes are authentic, communicate to real audiences, and reflect a purpose that is clear to the participants
•	Provide tasks that allow for active participation, exploration and experimentation
•	Invite personal response, evaluation and self-reflection to content and activities
•	Include activities that foster the use of imagination to solve novel and relevant problems, or make sense of complex ideas in creative ways
•	CHECKPOINT 7.3
•	Minimize threats and distractions
One of the most important things a teacher can do is to create a safe space for learners. To do this, teachers need to reduce potential threats and distractions in the learning environment. When learners have to focus their attention on having basic needs met or avoiding a negative experience they cannot concentrate on the learning process. While the physical safety of a learning environment is of course necessary, subtler types of threats and distractions must be attended to as well; what is threatening or potentially distracting depends on learners’ individual needs and background. An English Language Learner might find language experimentation threatening, while some learners might find too much sensory stimulation distracting. The optimal instructional environment offers options that reduce threats and negative distractions for everyone to create a safe space in which learning can occur.
•	Create an accepting and supportive classroom climate
•	Vary the level of novelty or risk
o	Charts, calendars, schedules, visible timers, cues, etc. that can increase the predictability of daily activities and transitions
o	Creation of class routines
o	Alerts and previews that can help learners anticipate and prepare for changes in activities, schedules, and novel events
o	Options that can, in contrast to the above, maximize the unexpected, surprising, or novel in highly routinized activities
•	Vary the level of sensory stimulation
o	Variation in the presence of background noise or visual stimulation, noise buffers, number of features or items presented at a time
o	Variation in pace of work, length of work sessions, availability of breaks or time-outs, or timing or sequence of activities
•	Vary the social demands required for learning or performance, the perceived level of support and protection and the requirements for public display and evaluation
•	Involve all participants in whole class discussions
