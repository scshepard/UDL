Page 3: UDL Principles
As you have learned, educators should anticipate differences in how their students learn and identify potential barriers within the instructional components. Even when they do so, educators may encounter challenges when designing instructional experiences for variable learners. The UDL framework is built on three principles that guide educators to plan more than one way (i.e., multiple means) to engage students, to represent content, and to promote student expression. By applying these three principles, educators design flexible instructional experiences that incorporate options for learners. Let’s explore these principles in greater depth.
The third principle is about the “how” of learning—the ways students take part in and express their learning. When designing with this principle in mind, educators plan more than one way for students to physically interact with learning experiences, to communicate their thinking and understanding, and to use executive functions. Examples of providing multiple means of action and expression include:
•	Providing alternatives to physical navigation or response methods using technology tools (e.g., keyboards, touch screens)
•	Supplying a variety of task-specific tools (e.g., physical or virtual manipulatives, calculators)
•	Offering students varied media options for composition (e.g., text, speech, comics, music, visual art, digital art, video)
•	Creating checklists or planning templates for projects (How can educators design instruction that engages and challenges all students?, 2024)

ChatGPT
Universal Design for Learning (UDL) emphasizes providing multiple means of action and expression to cater to diverse ways students can demonstrate their knowledge and skills. Here are examples of UDL's multiple means of action and expression, supported by scholarly citations.
1. Variety of Output Formats
Allowing students to demonstrate their understanding through different formats can address various strengths and preferences.
•	Example: Students can choose to write an essay, create a video, design a poster, or develop a digital presentation to showcase their learning.

2. Use of Assistive Technologies
Providing access to assistive technologies helps students with disabilities express their knowledge effectively.
•	Example: Implementing speech-to-text software for students with writing difficulties, screen readers for visually impaired students, or alternative keyboards and input devices.

8. Multiple Means of Communication
Allowing students to express their understanding through various communication methods can cater to different preferences and strengths.
•	Example: Students can choose to participate in discussions, submit written assignments, create digital content, or use art to convey their ideas.
•	Citation: CAST (2011). Universal Design for Learning Guidelines version 2.0. Wakefield, MA: Author. Available at: http://www.udlcenter.org/aboutudl/udlguidelines
9. Project-Based Learning and Real-World Applications
Involving students in project-based learning and real-world applications helps them connect their learning to practical contexts.
•	Example: Designing projects that require students to apply their knowledge to real-world problems or scenarios, fostering deeper understanding and engagement.
•	Citation: Barron, B., & Darling-Hammond, L. (2008). Teaching for Meaningful Learning: A Review of Research on Inquiry-Based and Cooperative Learning. Book Excerpt, George Lucas Educational Foundation.
By incorporating these strategies, educators can provide diverse and inclusive opportunities for students to demonstrate their knowledge and skills effectively.

Action & Expression
Provide multiple means of Action & Expression
Learners differ in the ways that they can navigate a learning environment and express what they know. For example, individuals with significant movement impairments (e.g., cerebral palsy), those who struggle with strategic and organizational abilities (executive function disorders), those who have language barriers, and so forth approach learning tasks very differently. Some may be able to express themselves well in written text but not speech, and vice versa. It should also be recognized that action and expression require a great deal of strategy, practice, and organization, and this is another area in which learners can differ. In reality, there is not one means of action and expression that will be optimal for all learners; providing options for action and expression is essential.

Provide options for Physical Action
CHECKPOINT 4.1
Vary the methods for response and navigation
Learners differ widely in their capacity to navigate their physical environment. To reduce barriers to learning that would be introduced by the motor demands of a task, provide alternative means for response, selection, and composition. In addition, learners differ widely in their optimal means for navigating through information and activities. To provide equal opportunity for interaction with learning experiences, an instructor must ensure that there are multiple means for navigation and control is accessible.
•	Provide alternatives in the requirements for rate, timing, speed, and range of motor action required to interact with instructional materials, physical manipulatives, and technologies
•	Provide alternatives for physically responding or indicating selections (e.g., alternatives to marking with pen and pencil, alternatives to mouse control)
•	Provide alternatives for physically interacting with materials by hand, voice, single switch, joystick, keyboard, or adapted keyboard
•	CHECKPOINT 4.2
•	Optimize access to tools and assistive technologies
Providing a learner with a tool is often not enough. We need to provide the support to use the tool effectively. Many learners need help navigating through their environment (both in terms of physical space and the curriculum), and all learners should be given the opportunity to use tools that might help them meet the goal of full participation in the classroom. However, significant numbers of learners with disabilities have to use Assistive Technologies for navigation, interaction, and composition on a regular basis. It is critical that instructional technologies and curricula do not impose inadvertent barriers to the use of these assistive technologies. An important design consideration, for example, is to ensure that there are keyboard commands for any mouse action so that learners can use common assistive technologies that depend upon those commands. It is also important, however, to ensure that making a lesson physically accessible does not inadvertently remove its challenge to learning.
•	Provide alternate keyboard commands for mouse action
•	Build switch and scanning options for increased independent access and keyboard alternatives
•	Provide access to alternative keyboards
•	Customize overlays for touch screens and keyboards
•	Select software that works seamlessly with keyboard alternatives and alt keys
