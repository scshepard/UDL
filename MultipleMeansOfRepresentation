Page 3: UDL Principles

As you have learned, educators should anticipate differences in how their students learn and identify potential barriers within the instructional components. Even when they do so, educators may encounter challenges when designing instructional experiences for variable learners. The UDL framework is built on three principles that guide educators to plan more than one way (i.e., multiple means) to engage students, to represent content, and to promote student expression. By applying these three principles, educators design flexible instructional experiences that incorporate options for learners. Let’s explore these principles in greater depth.
Provide Multiple Means of Representation
The second principle is about the “what” of learning—the content that is presented to learners. When designing with this principle in mind, educators make sure to use more than one way to present information, to clarify and promote a shared understanding of the language and symbols used in the content, and to foster students’ comprehension. Examples of providing multiple means of representation include:
•	Presenting alternatives to text-based information (e.g., images, videos, interactive media, simulations)
•	Displaying video captions
•	Hyperlinking definitions to new vocabulary in a text
•	Offering text-to-speech software when decoding is not the focus of instruction
•	Providing graphic organizers to guide information processing (How can educators design instruction that engages and challenges all students?, 2024)

masters level: give examples UDL Multiple Means of Representation with citations
Universal Design for Learning (UDL) is a framework aimed at improving and optimizing teaching and learning for all people based on scientific insights into how humans learn. The UDL principles include providing multiple means of representation, which is essential for addressing the diverse ways in which students perceive and comprehend information. Below are examples of multiple means of representation, supported by scholarly citations.
1. Use of Multimedia and Digital Texts
Incorporating multimedia resources such as videos, podcasts, and interactive websites can cater to different learning preferences. For example, videos can support auditory and visual learners by combining spoken word with images and text.

2. Providing Alternatives for Texts
Offering text alternatives such as audio recordings, Braille, or large print texts helps students with visual impairments or reading difficulties.

4. Accessible Instructional Materials
Ensuring that all instructional materials are accessible, such as providing captions for videos and transcripts for audio content, ensures that students with hearing impairments or those who need additional processing time can access the same information as their peers.

5. Interactive Simulations and Models
Using simulations and models, such as virtual labs or interactive maps, allows students to engage with the material in an experiential and hands-on way, which can be particularly beneficial for kinesthetic learners.

6. Flexible Formats and Tools
Providing content in various formats, such as e-books, PDFs, and online articles, along with tools that allow text-to-speech or speech-to-text, gives students options to choose the format that best suits their learning needs.

By implementing these multiple means of representation, educators can create a more inclusive learning environment that acknowledges and supports the diverse learning styles and needs of all students.

•	What does multiple means of representation mean?
o	Providing learners various ways to access and engage with course materials and information
o	In its simplest form, this could mean offering textbooks in audio or multimedia formats.
o	This principle also refers to how students comprehend information in different forms, such as decoding syntax, vocabulary notation, symbols, and disciplinary language.
o	The goal is to support students in using multiple representations and developing fluency in traversing across them.
o	Offering flexibility in presenting information also acknowledges differences in how learners comprehend and perceive information.
o	For example, students with visual impairment may find print materials inaccessible, and students with diverse languages, cultural backgrounds, accesses needs may encounter barriers to information when educators assume common backgrounds.
o	In a learning environment that applies this principle, material and content are presented in a variety of ways at the outset.
o	The principle also includes pedagogical approaches to a topic or concept. An educator could decide to give a concept overview (lecture) followed by an example an application of the concept through an in-class exercise.
o	Other examples of approaches include statistics, case studies, and expert opinion
o	If one approach is ineffective, a different approach may work better.

________________________________________
1. Teach metacognitive strategies for learning within context of this concept or skill.
•	Use analogies and metaphors.
•	Teach notetaking and study strategies.
•	Present a mnemonic orally and visually to help students remember new information—or help students create a mnemonic, such as a song.
•	Connect the concept to something students already know, using several modalities.
•	Chunk material into smaller pieces.
•	Create study guides with strategies for learning embedded.
2. Use multiple means to represent content, concepts, and skills.
•	Use slides with photographs and text, or a video, to enhance a mini-lecture.
•	Give students the option to listen to text, read it, or both.
•	Present content through a graphic organizer.

3. Provide help with vocabulary, syntax, notations, and symbols.
•	Use translations for English learners.
•	Provide support for decoding text.
•	Clarify the meanings of symbols and notations.
•	Use scaffolds to support syntax and sentence structure.
4. Gradually release support to promote independence.
•	Model and use examples and non-examples.
•	Use guided practice and collaborative learning experiences.
•	As assessments show students gaining capability with a skill, move to independent practice.
5. Create experiences for deliberate practice, spaced over time.
•	Help students select the level of difficulty that’s just beyond what they’re confident they know/can do, but that can be achieved with practice and concentration.
•	Provide learning experiences that allow and require students to persist with concentration across many days, with time between each experience—such as problems that include provocative questions, conflict, and contradictions.
•	Let students identify and select conditions under which they concentrate and persist best.
•	Minimize distractions during times of deliberate practice and concentration.
6. Give formative feedback.
•	Provide clear, ungraded feedback on products of learning and the process of learning.
•	Guide students to evaluate their own learning.
•	Conference with individual students about a product or process; help them generate a plan for what to do next.
•	Share feedback in ways that show confidence in the student’s ability to learn.
•	Connect feedback to specific learning goals.
7. Use formative assessment to change instruction.
Use formative assessment of students’ work and learning to:
•	inform the strategies you use in the remainder of the unit.
•	determine whether students are ready for more independent practice and learning.
•	make decisions about flexible grouping.
•	make decisions about supplemental instruction for small groups.

Representation
Provide multiple means of Representation
Learners differ in the ways that they perceive and comprehend information that is presented to them. For example, those with sensory disabilities (e.g., blindness or deafness); learning disabilities (e.g., dyslexia); language or cultural differences, and so forth may all require different ways of approaching content. Others may simply grasp information quicker or more efficiently through visual or auditory means rather than printed text. Also learning, and transfer of learning, occurs when multiple representations are used, because they allow students to make connections within, as well as between, concepts. In short, there is not one means of representation that will be optimal for all learners; providing options for representation is essential.
GUIDELINE 1
Provide options for Perception
Learning is impossible if information is imperceptible to the learner, and difficult when information is presented in formats that require extraordinary effort or assistance. To reduce barriers to learning, it is important to ensure that key information is equally perceptible to all learners by: 1) providing the same information through different modalities (e.g., through vision, hearing, or touch); 2) providing information in a format that will allow for adjustability by the user (e.g., text that can be enlarged, sounds that can be amplified). Such multiple representations not only ensure that information is accessible to learners with particular sensory and perceptual disabilities, but also easier to access and comprehend for many others.
CHECKPOINT 1.1
Offer ways of customizing the display of information
In print materials, the display of information is fixed and permanent. In properly prepared digital materials, the display of the same information is very malleable and customizable. For example, a call-out box of background information may be displayed in a different location, or enlarged, or emphasized by the use of color, or deleted entirely. Such malleability provides options for increasing the perceptual clarity and salience of information for a wide range of learners and adjustments for preferences of others. While these customizations are difficult with print materials, they are commonly available automatically in digital materials, though it cannot be assumed that because it is digital it is accessible as many digital materials are equally inaccessible. Educators and learners should work together to attain the best match of features to learning needs.
•	Display information in a flexible format so that the following perceptual features can be varied:
o	The size of text, images, graphs, tables, or other visual content
o	The contrast between background and text or image
o	The color used for information or emphasis
o	The volume or rate of speech or sound
o	The speed or timing of video, animation, sound, simulations, etc.
o	The layout of visual or other elements
o	The font used for print materials
CHECKPOINT 1.2
•	Offer alternatives for auditory information
Sound is a particularly effective way to convey the impact of information, which is why sound design is so important in movies and why the human voice is particularly effective for conveying emotion and significance. However, information conveyed solely through sound is not equally accessible to all learners and is especially inaccessible for learners with hearing disabilities, for learners who need more time to process information, or for learners who have memory difficulties. In addition, listening itself is a complex strategic skill that must be learned. To ensure that all learners have access to learning, options should be available for any information, including emphasis, presented aurally.
•	Use text equivalents in the form of captions or automated speech-to-text (voice recognition) for spoken language
•	Provide visual diagrams, charts, notations of music or sound
•	Provide written transcripts for videos or auditory clips
•	Provide American Sign Language (ASL) for spoken English
•	Use visual analogues to represent emphasis and prosody (e.g., emoticons, symbols, or images)
•	Provide visual or tactile (e.g., vibrations) equivalents for sound effects or alerts
•	Provide visual and/or emotional description for musical interpretation
CHECKPOINT 1.3
•	Offer alternatives for visual information
Images, graphics, animations, video, or text are often the optimal way to present information, especially when the information is about the relationships between objects, actions, numbers, or events.  But such visual representations are not equally accessible to all learners, especially learners with visual disabilities or those who are not familiar with the type of graphic being used. Visual information can be quite dense, particularly with visual art, which can have multiple complex meanings and interpretations depending on contextual factors and the viewer’s knowledge base. To ensure that all learners have equal access to information, it is essential to provide non-visual alternatives.
•	Provide descriptions (text or spoken) for all images, graphics, video, or animations
•	Use touch equivalents (tactile graphics or objects of reference) for key visuals that represent concepts
•	Provide physical objects and spatial models to convey perspective or interaction
•	Provide auditory cues for key concepts and transitions in visual information
Text is a special case of visual information. The transformation from text into audio is among the most easily accomplished methods for increasing accessibility.  The advantage of text over audio is its permanence, but providing text that is easily transformable into audio accomplishes that permanence without sacrificing the advantages of audio.  Digital synthetic text-to-speech is increasingly effective but still disappoints in its ability to carry the valuable information in prosody.
•	Follow accessibility standards (NIMAS, DAISY, etc.) when creating digital text
•	Allow for a competent aide, partner, or “intervener” to read text aloud
•	Provide access to text-to-speech software
